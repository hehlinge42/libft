# libft @42

## Project

The libft project aims at developing many tools including:
- string manipulation functions
- memory manipulation functions
- chained lists manipulation functions
- print functions
- etc.

Many of them are already available in libraries such as `string.h` but their use is forbidden at 42.
The project's subject is available in the repository
